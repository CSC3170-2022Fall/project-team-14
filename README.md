# CSC3170 Course Project

## Project Overall Description

This is our implementation for the course project of CSC3170, 2022 Fall, CUHK(SZ). For details of the project, you can refer to [project-description.md](project-description.md). In this project, we will utilize what we learned in the lectures and tutorials in the course, and implement either one of the following major job:

<!-- Please fill in "x" to replace the blank space between "[]" to tick the todo item; it's ticked on the first one by default. -->

- [x] **Application with Database System(s)**
- [ ] **Implementation of a Database System**

## Project Specification

<!-- You should remove the terms/sentence that is not necessary considering your option/branch/difficulty choice -->

After thorough discussion, our team made the choice and the specification information is listed below:

- Our option choice is: **Option 1**
- Our branch choice is: **Branch 1**
- The difficulty level is: **Normal**


Our project structure and implementation can be found in [material/todo-list.md](./material/todo-list.md).
## Project Abstract
> <font size = 4>Here is the main structure of our designed databaseÔºö</font>
### 1. Major Functionalities
- Register the package information that is 
released by some consumer
- Allow the consumer to appoint some plant for 
some package manually
- The assignment and the start-time of some 
operation with some machine could be further set 
under the constraint of plant appointment
- Once some operation is successfully finished, 
the processing record in end-time and expense 
could be written back.
- The production information, like manufacture 
capacity of some plant, or the demand changes of 
some consumer within some period of time can be 
calculated.
- Construct a bank system for consumers to complete their payments to the plant owner. Meanwhile, both consumers and plant owners can check their account balance through system websites.
<br></br>

### 2. Function Assumption
> <font size = 3.5>Request:</font>
- Relation between consumer and package possession:  
one-to-many relation  
One consumer can have multiple packages.

- Random allocation:  
If consumer doesn't appoint plant, our system will allocate one plant 
for him.

- Relation between packages and chips:
one-to-one relation  
One package refers to one type of chip. 

> <font size = 3.5>Production:</font> 
- Relation between plant and machine types:  
One plant holds one to many machines of the same type.

- No parallism for a single machine:  
One machine can process one operation at the same time.

- Relation between operation type and plant:  
One operation in a package can be assigned to only one plant.

- Consistency of plants for a single package:  
All processes(operations) of one package will be finished in the same plant, which means that the machine type of this plant will change after all chips finishes some process(operation).

> <font size = 3.5>Output:</font>
- Processing record:  
Processing record involves the start time, end time and expense of 
one operation processed on one machine.

- Waiting condition(test for demands):  
If all the plants are busy at certain time period, packages will be 
put in the waiting list. As soon as there is a free plant, package will be appointted.  

> <font size = 3.5>Possession and bank system:</font>
- Relation between plant and plant owners:  
A plant can belong to only one plant owner, but one plant owner could 
have multiple plants. 

- Both the consumer and the plant owner both has (for simplification, 
only one) bank account.
